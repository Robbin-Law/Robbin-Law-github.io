## Software to Download and Install

### Download and Install CodeWarrior Software and USBDM Drivers

- [USBDM First set of Drivers](assets/tool-chain-software/USBDMPod/USBDM_Drivers_4_12_1_Win_x64.msi){download=""}
  - Download and install this **first**.

- [CodeWarrior5.1](assets/tool-chain-software/CodeWarrior5.1/CW_HC12_v5.1_SPECIAL.exe){download=""}
  - Download and install this **second**. 
  - Do not store it in ```C:\Program Files (x86)```, put it in another folder on the ```C:\``` drive that has **NO spaces** in the folder name.
  - The very last step in the install asks if you want to update, we **DO NOT** want to update, so just cancel that.

- [USBDM Second set of Drivers](assets/tool-chain-software/USBDMPod/USBDM_4_12_1_262_Win.msi){download=""}
  - Download and install this **third** after CodeWarrior has been successfully installed.

### Download and Install Git

- [Git Website](https://git-scm.com/){target="_blank"}
- Download the latest version. Allow all the defaults on download. The path should be updated automatically, so that `git` is available from any directory.
- Open a PowerShell or CMD terminal. In the shell run `git â€“version` to make sure that git is installed and accessible from this directory. Note that it is two minus bars before version. If a version number is not returned, the path must be set so that `git` is available from any directory. To set the path, in the search area at the bottom of the windows task bar type `env` and select `Edit Environment Variables for your Account`. Then edit the `PATH` and add new `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd`. You could add this to the system environments alternatively. Now you can run the `git` command from a terminal anywhere.

### Download and Install GitHub CLI

- [GitHub CLI Website](https://cli.github.com/){target="_blank"}
- Download the latest version. Allow all the defaults on download. The path should be updated automatically, so that `gh` is available from any directory.

### Download and Install Visual Studio Code

- [Visual Studio Code Website](https://code.visualstudio.com){target="_blank"}
- Download Visual Studio Code if you do not already have it on your machine.
