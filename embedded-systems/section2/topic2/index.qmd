## Procedure to Create a New Code Warrior Project

- When you open CodeWarrior a **Startup dialog box** should appear, if not go to **File/Start Dialog...**

- From the Startup Dialog box click **Create New Project**.

- Then under **Select the derivative to use** choose **HCS12XD Family/MC9S12XDP512**

- Also choose **USBDM** in the **Connections** box. Then click **next**.

- Then choose **Single Core**, and click **next**.

- Then make sure the **C** box is checked and all others not. 

- Change the name of the project to something that makes sense for example `ICA01`. 

- Change the place to store the project to the `ICAs` folder in your workbook repo. Click **next**.

**Remember This** - The only way to tell where the project is to be stored is when creating the project. You cannot `save as` the project as a whole via the IDE anywhere else after it has been created.

- No need to **add existing files** so click **next**.

- We want **None** for **Rapid Dev Options**. Click **next**.

- Choose **ANSI Startup Code**, **Small Memory Model**, and **IEEE32 for both float and double**. Click **next**.

- Finally check **NO** to PC-lint. Click **Finish**.

## Procedure to download a project to Code Warrior

Now that the project has been created and stored in your local workbook repo, we will want to change the `main.c` file to reflect the problem we are solving and then download the project to our micro board and run the program in `main.c`.

- From the `project root folder` in the `ICAs` folder, right click and via the context sensitive menu choose `Open in File Explorer`.

- Delete the folder called `PROJECTNAME_Data`.

- Then double click on the file called `PROJECTNAME.mcp`. This will load the whole project into the Code Warrior IDE. You may have to search for where the IDE is on your machine. By default that location will be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Freescale\CWS12v5.1\bin\IDE.exe`. You may have located the Code Warrior software somewhere else when you installed the software.

## Procedure to run a program in Code Warrior

Now that the project is loaded into Code Warrior we can complile and run it in our micro board.

- In CodeWarrior double click on the `main.c` file so you can see the program that you are about to run on the micro board.

- In CodeWarrior, start the **Real-Time Debugger** by clicking the **slanted green arrow**. This will compile and load the program into the micro board.

- Click on **OK**, once or twice until the program is downloaded to the micro board. You may also have had to click on **YES** to connect to the micro board via the USBDM module.

- Run the program by clicking the horizontal **green Start arrow**.

- Click the **red Reset Target arrow** to stop the program.
