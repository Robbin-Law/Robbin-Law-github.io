- [ICA02 Code Migration from C# to C Specs](assets/CMPE1250_ICA02_1231.pdf){target="_blank"}

- [C# Program.cs for ICA02](assets/Program.cs){target="_blank"}

- Use the same procedure outlined for ICA01 to create a new project in the `ICAs` folder of your local workbook repo, but name it ICA02. 

- In VSCode change the `main.c` file of this new project to solve the problem outlined in the specs document.

- The intention of this ICA02 is to convert the `Program.cs` C# program into a C program that will run on the micro board.
